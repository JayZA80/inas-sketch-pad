If the counter is the same number as the given number * itself:
Stop running this function

Also, if the counter is higher than the given number * itself:
Remove a child element
Decrement the counter until it matches the given number * itself

Else:
While we want to repeat code:
Check if the counter is at given number
Say we don't want to repeat code
If the counter is not at given number, create a div element
Add the div element to the parent container
Listen for when the div element is clicked, if it's clicked run function x
Increment the counter
