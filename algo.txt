Declare a counter variable
Declare a variable to keep track of if we want to continue repeating code
Declare a function (x) with a parameter as an event (e)
Record the target element that triggered the event
Add/Remove a class from the target element

While we want to repeat code:
Check if the counter is at 16
Say we don't want to repeat code
If the counter is not at 16, create a div element
Add the div element to the parent container
Listen for when the div element is clicked, if it's clicked run function x
Increment the counter
